    summary: |
      Add "See also" sections to regex-related function docstrings to improve
      documentation discoverability by cross-linking related functions. This
      fixes issue #56752 which requested improved documentation navigation
      between regex functions.

    issue_context: |
      Issue #56752 opened by @jariji on 2024-12-04 requested: "The regex function
      docstrings could link to each other, to remind users what they all are."
      The issue identified functions including match, eachmatch, findall, findfirst,
      findnext, count, replace, occursin, startswith, endswith, chopprefix, chopsuffix,
      Regex and r"" as candidates for cross-referencing. Labeled as "docs" and
      "good first issue".
    review_context: |
      Reviewer LilithHafner noted that some functions (startswith, endswith) already
      had "See also" sections. Rather than creating duplicates, the contributor
      consolidated entries by extending existing references. The PR was approved
      on 2025-10-08 and merged by IanButterworth on 2025-10-11.

    notes: |
      This PR makes no changes to any function implementations, type definitions,
      or APIs. All changes are confined to docstrings (documentation strings).
      There are no compatibility concerns.

  performance:
    compile_time: []

    notes: "No performance impact - documentation-only change."

  downstream_impact:
    affected_packages: []
    notes: |
      This PR has no impact on downstream packages. The changes are purely
      documentation improvements that enhance discoverability of related
      regex functions in the help system.

  risk:
    level: "low"
    rationale:
      - "Documentation-only changes with no code modifications"
      - "No functional behavior changes"
      - "No API surface changes"
      - "Labeled as 'docs' by maintainers"
      - "Simple addition of cross-references between existing functions"
      - "All 7 CI checks passed before merge"
      - "Independently verified: patch modifies only docstring content in base/regex.jl"

  open_questions: []

  recommendations:
    - "No action required for downstream packages"
    - "This is a documentation improvement with no breaking changes"

  independent_verification:
    date: "2026-01-21"
    findings: |
      Independent analysis confirmed:
      1. All changes are confined to docstrings (documentation strings) only
      2. No function implementations, type definitions, or code paths are modified
      3. The patch (+11/-2 lines) exclusively modifies documentation markup
      4. startswith and endswith had pre-existing "See also" sections that were
         extended (added match reference), not replaced
      5. match, count, and eachmatch received entirely new "See also" sections
      6. Cross-references use standard Julia docstring syntax [@ref] which
         has no runtime impact
    verification_method: |
      - Examined full patch data from pr_59744.json

changelog:
  category: "Documentation"
  entry: |
    Added "See also" sections to regex function docstrings (`match`, `eachmatch`,
    `count`, `startswith`, `endswith`) to improve documentation navigation and
    discoverability of related pattern-matching functions.
